    "The objective of this project is to analyze life expectancy data using multiple regression modeling techniques. By employing multiple regression, we aim to identify and quantify the relationships that exist between various factors or predictors and life expectancy. This analysis will provide insights into the key drivers of life expectancy and help stakeholders make informed decisions related to public health, healthcare policies, and socioeconomic development."

    " This project seeks to address the importance of understanding the factors that significantly affect life expectancy. Traditional approaches to public health analysis often rely on limited analysis or anecdotal evidence, leading to incomplete insights. This knowledge gap hampers policymakers' ability to predict and interpret changes in life expectancy effectively. To address this problem, we propose utilizing multiple regression modeling techniques to comprehensively analyze life expectancy data. By conducting multiple regression, we can identify the relationships between different factors and life expectancy, taking into account the collective impact of multiple independent variable"
